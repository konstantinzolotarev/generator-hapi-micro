## Branch explanation

Our repository has two main branches:

1. [master](https://github.com/ghaiklor/generator-sails-rest-api/tree/master "Master Branch")
2. [dev](https://github.com/ghaiklor/generator-sails-rest-api/tree/dev "Development Branch")

All releases will merge into `master` branch.
So if you want to get and use the latest release - use `master` branch.

But, of course, you can use edge version and check out our latest features.
They are may be unstable and not tested, so they are not ready for production.
All those changes and features will merge into `dev` branch.

Other branches it's only helper branches which can close at any time.
In general we have 3 types of branches:

+ Feature branches;
+ Release branches;
+ Hotfix branches;

## Git workflow

We are using git workflow, which are nice described [here in Russian](http://habrahabr.ru/post/106912/ "Thanks to Андрей Хитрин aka zloddey") and [here in English](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ "Thanks to Vincent Driessen").

In general, we are using `master` branch for stable releases (and ONLY stable releases) and `dev` branch for development purposes.

## Publishing

`semantic-release` is a package that allows to publish to npm after tests completed successfully right from the CI server.
This flow is fully configured, so you can just contribute to the project, everything else `semantic-release` will do.

## Tests

We are using Mocha for testing.
All test cases located into `test` folder.

When you create new feature or fix some bug, you **MUST** write test case for it in `test` folder.

For running tests just call `npm test`.
